These are my suggestions for the areas where improvements are needed.

1. Project Planning
    Issues:
    - Incomplete tasks close to the deadline
    Suggestions:
    - Break the project into the smaller tasks with clear deadlines
    - Assign tasks to the specific members or team that are capable to complete it.
    - Do daily stand up meetings to track the progress of task or project

2. Bug Management
    Issues:
    - Unresolved bugs nearing the deadline.
    Suggestions:
    - Identify and document the bugs early as possible
    - Prioritize bugs by its severity
    - Allocate time specifically for bug fixing

3. Testing Processe
    Issues:
    - Testing has not started yet.
    Suggestions:
    - Implement continuous testing throughout the project.
    - Start testing early in the development process.
    - Use automated testing tools.

4. Communication
    Issues:
    - Due to the issues currently experiencing, there is a possiblity of communication gaps 
      between the working teams.
    Suggestions:
    - Hold daily stand-up meetings.
    - Use collaboration tools like Slack, Trello or anything that developer team prefered to use
    - Gather regular feedback from team members.

5. Risk Management
    Issues:
    - Lack of proactive risk management.
    Suggestions:
    - Conduct regular risk assessments.
    - Develop plans to mitigate identified risks.
    - Build flexibility into the schedule for unforeseen issues.


In conclusion, better planning, 
               continuous testing, 
               effective communication, 
               and proactive risk management 
               can help ensure timely project delivery and high-quality outcomes.
